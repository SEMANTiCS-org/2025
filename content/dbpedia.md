# DBpedia Day 2024
SEMANTiCS 2024 will host the **DBpedia Day** on September 17, 2024 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

## Community Meeting
[DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org/) is an international crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia, Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons and to make this information available on the Web as Linked Open Data. 

DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph.

DBpedia has become a high-impact, high-visibility project because of our foundation in excellent Knowledge Engineering as the pivot point between scientific methods, innovation and industrial-grade output. The drivers behind DBpedia are 4 out of the [TOP 10 Most Influential Scholars](https://www.aminer.org/ai2000/ke) in Knowledge Engineering and the C-level executives of our members.

## Organisation
* Julia Holze, InfAI, DBpedia Association
* Milan Dojchinovski, InfAI, DBpedia Association, CTU
* Sebastian Hellmann, InfAI, DBpedia Association

## This year's topics
We invite the world’s leading Knowledge Engineering experts to gain insights on the topic “Knowledge Graphs operated by AI”. This event aims to explore how recent advances in AI can leverage and exploit structured knowledge, as well as address new challenges and necessary changes to advance the vision of “Knowledge Graphs operated by AI”. Please find more information at the [Call for Presentations.](https://www.dbpedia.org/blog/cfp-dbpedia-day-2024/)

## Highlights include
* Keynote presentation “Trust me, I’m a Human” by Ruben Verborgh (Ghent University - imec)
* Session “Knowledge Graphs for LLMs”
* Session “LLMs for Knowledge Graphs”
* Discussion Session on LLMs and Knowledge Graphs

### About Ruben Verborgh: 
I’m a Professor of Decentralized Web Technology at [IDLab](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en) of Ghent University – imec and a Visiting Fellow at the Oxford Martin School within the University of Oxford. I’m the Head of Data Interoperability at Inrupt and an advisor to other companies. From this hybrid academic and industrial perspective, my professional mission is to support Solid in inspiring, transforming, and reshaping our data-driven society. 

As a computer scientist, I investigate how decentralized knowledge graphs on the Web can lead us into the post-Big Data era, where companies realize that data harvesting as a business model is a dead end. The future consists of lots of small data that is [linked](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2018/12/28/designing-a-linked-data-developer-experience/#backend-independent). [People will be in control](https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/) of where they store their data and with whom they share it, independently of the services they use. I’m researching and implementing technologies that enable us to [effect this socio-economic change](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2020/12/07/a-data-ecosystem-fosters-sustainable-innovation/) on both a local and a global scale.
