<p id="SeMats" style="font-size: 21px;"><b><a style="text-decoration: none; margin: 0 !important" target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/view/semanticmaterials">International Workshop on Semantic Materials Science: Harnessing the Power of Semantic Web (SeMats)</a></b></p>

<p style="text-align: justify !important;">Advanced technological solutions are pivotal for leveraging data in innovative research, but compatibility issues in scientific data hinder progress. Interoperability and efficient data access are crucial, and the Semantic Web emerges as a powerful solution. Historically, the intersection  between Semantic Web (SW) technologies, and Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) dates back before the formalization of the Semantic  Web concept in 2001. For instance, the creation of the Plinius ontology in 1994 provided a language-independent conceptual construction  kit for the chemical composition of materials. Recent conferences in the MSE domain, such as the FEMS-Euromat (European Congress and Exhibition on Advanced Materials and Processes) and MSE congress, show a significant increase in Semantic Web applications, with over ten SW-related presentations in 2022 and more than 20 in 2023. This growing  adoption prompts a focus on attracting participants at the intersection of both areas. The Semantic Web, widely adopted in life sciences, proves beneficial in Materials Science Engineering. Expanding Semantic  Web technologies to the Materials Science domain can enhance research outcomes by enabling the uniform consideration of heterogeneous data.  It improves traceability and reproducibility and facilitates automatable data management solutions. The primary objective of the proposed workshop is to gather works applying Semantic Web Technologies in  Materials Science, making these technologies accessible to a broader community. The workshop aims to provide an overview of existing  approaches, identify relevant works, and bring together Materials Science and Semantic Web stakeholders for collaboration and innovation. Join us in exploring the transformative possibilities of Semantic Web Technologies in Materials Science, paving the way for a more interconnected and efficient research landscape.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify !important;">Building a domain knowledge graph from a large amount of text requires a tremendous amount of work, including entity recognition, entity disambiguation and relationship extraction. Because of this, more work has been done on automated ways to generate knowledge graphs from text. Recent efforts in NLP (Natural Language Processing) development have shown that semantic deep neural networks can learn the complex syntactic and semantics of the natural language and thus, give more potential for automation even in the most complex domains i.e., legal documents. New approaches to KG development use a combination of extraction methods and state-of-the-art NLP techniques. Additionally, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are able to learn powerful embeddings which leverage topological structures in the KGs and provide explanations of the outcome. Despite the successes this existing research has achieved, deep learning on graphs for NLP still faces many challenges. Presentation of challenges faced in specific domains such as Science, Sustainability is also welcomed. For instance, in the sciences, the production of resources (e.g., publications) is growing at a rate that outstrips an individual’s capacity to discovery and utilize them. As a result, alongside manual methods to structure and make discoverable that knowledge, automation is vital. We welcome applications that analyze and synthesize large volumes of scientific information (especially scientific literature, notes documents, and dataset metadata) and can use that information to create ontologies and semantic representations that better organize them. We also welcome contributions that address automation components of maintenance of ontologies and knowledge graphs. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify !important;">This workshop invites contributions on methods and approaches of knowledge and data extraction from text, as well as theoretical and practical aspects of using semantic deep NLP for KG creation and the use of such KG for Graph Neural Network (GNN) tasks.</p>

<p id="LLM" style="font-size: 21px;"><b><a style="text-decoration: none; margin: 0 !important" target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/view/llmskgs">Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs unified: use cases and examples</a></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify !important;">Large Language models (LLMs) and Generative AI have changed drastically the way we look at knowledge representation and use. Many organizations are investigating how to generate business value from the combination of the two words; LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Responsible AI is a key topic of discussion. As with data, it is not only an asset that can be used, but also a liability that needs to be managed. Concerns like biases and hallucinations are hard problems to be solved. On the other hand, KGs are well understood and widely used concepts for knowledge representation. They do not suffer from the aforementioned concerns, but the flip side is that maintaining KGs is often a task which requires considerable human effort and using KGs is often harder than using LLMs.This workshop is all about combining LLMs and KGs. It focusses on real-life, practical use-cases that industry (both commercial and governmental organizations) are currently working on. All talks are presented by invited speakers from industry and research organizations and will present what works in a practical setting to add business value and use AI in a responsible way.
You can expect discussions on use cases like:

<p style="text-align: justify !important;">It's 2024 and we still can't visit any website without clicking "Yes" on a cookie banner, exchanging access to our most private data for the right to browse around. Managing and enforcing our privacy preferences in a personalised manner is also quite challenging. Additionally, data protection laws are emerging exponentially following in the footsteps of the GDPR. In this context, the NeXt-generation Data Governance 2024 workshop aims to bring together technical, legal and societal researchers, and industry experts to discuss data governance, emergence of data spaces and the impact of the European strategy for data in such systems. The workshop aims to support the development of solutions to manage data, policies and provenance in a trustful and interoperable manner and to aid in the management and reporting of legal documentation falling from the EU’s GDPR for data protection and the DGA, Data Act, AI Act and EHDS to create legally-aligned, AI-powered data ecosystems, using semantic-based specifications such as ODRL, DPV or Solid. As such, this workshop will have presentations and discussions of interest to both data providers and consumers, researchers, standardisation bodies, businesses, and citizens who want to interoperate in the Data Spaces era. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify !important;">Knowledge Graphs have been used in industrial settings for many years. However, in many cases the use cases have been limited to storage, integration and information retrieval tasks. We identify the lack of scalable solutions as the main blocker for uptake in more use cases. In this workshop, we want to foster discussion on making knowledge graph systems work at industrial scale. We do explicitly not want to limit this discussion to how much data we can store and query (this is already pretty much working), but also how we can deal with other scalability aspects such as processing, streaming, and ingestion of large amounts of information into a knowledge graph systems.</p>

he main purpose of many industrial KG applications is providing the right information to
the right person at the right time. From an information point of view (i. e. with respect to
information units and information types,) this goal is supported by iiRDS, the intelligent
information request and delivery standard. However, information is not “free floating”, but
typically and necessarily related to a specific product or a specific component of a product.
Nonetheless, there seems to be no common understanding of how knowledge about a
product is represented. iiRDS itself only offers so-called “docking points”. This typically
leads to highly specialized, customized, and even co-existing representations of the product
domain, making data-interoperability an even greater task. The goal of this tutorial is to
discuss existing approaches to product ontology modeling from various perspectives such
as iiRDS, Asset Administration Shell, custom ontologies and/or eClass. The participants aim
at identifying agreement and/or deviation of existing approaches and ideally seek
developing the framework for a common approach to the modeling of product ontologies.

Data sharing accelerates innovations within and across sectors, leading to the development of new solutions. For a growing number of companies, this turns data into a strategic asset over which they want to maintain control. The European strategy for data aims to create common European data spaces to ensure Europe’s global competitiveness and data sovereignty. Data spaces are distributed systems designed to facilitate secure and trustworthy data exchanges between participants, emphasizing trust and data sovereignty. One of the crucial aspect in making this happen is semantics, which enables consistent and unambiguous data sharing between participants of a data space. Achieving semantic interoperability is a continuous balancing act between maintaining strict uniformity for consistent and easily understandable data, and accommodating the diverse requirements of different data space participants. This tutorial offers practical insights into shaping semantics within data spaces, with TNO’s Semantic Treehouse as so-called vocabulary hub as an important means. The tutorial highlights the challenges and presents solutions for achieving semantic interoperability in the context of data spaces.
