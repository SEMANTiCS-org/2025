This year marks a significant milestone for the SEMANTiCS Conference as we celebrate its 20th anniversary. Over the past two decades, the conference has grown and is now among the major forums for scholars, researchers, end-users, and industry players. The SEMANTiCS Conference has created a lively community where collaboration and knowledge exchange are in its basics, fostering a dynamic environment for learning and innovation. 

Mark your calendars for September 17-19, 2024, because this year's SEMANTiCS Conference is going to be nothing short of spectacular! The 20th anniversary will be held  in the beautiful city of Amsterdam, known for its canals network, historical architecture, tulips, and cultural richness. And here's a little nugget of information for you: the Netherlands, our host country, is the very birthplace of the knowledge graph, adding a layer of historical significance to this gathering.
What's more, we're returning to the Meervaart building, the stage for our last two successful conferences in Amsterdam in 2017 and 2021. The lively theater dynamics will give the conference an inspiring atmosphere. Every year the Meervaart hosts more than 150 business conferences and events and we have very good memories.

But that's not all! Celebrating its 20th anniversary, the SEMANTiCS Conference brings an element of surprise to mark this milestone. The program committee is thrilled to announce that there will be a series of unexpected delights and experiences, adding an extra layer of excitement to this year's conference journey. While we won't reveal all the surprises just yet, we can assure you that each day of the conference will unfold with unexpected moments, be it exclusive insights from industry leaders, surprise guest speakers, or interactive activities designed to foster connections.

Last year the conference was held in Leipzig, Germany, where over 300 attendees participated. SEMANTiCS 2024 will continue the commitment to be the venue where international scientists from academia and industry meet to accelerate progress in the field. 
Stay tuned to this blog for further updates, and prepare to embark on a memorable semantic journey in the heart of Amsterdam!
