<h1>Industry &amp; Use Case Presentations</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify !important;">The Industry &amp; Use Case track at SEMANTiCS welcomes submissions that present use cases and industry adoption of semantic technology. Solutions that deal with semantic processing of data and/or information in areas like Linked Data, Knowledge Graphs, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Publishing, Thesaurus and/or Ontology management, and any related fields. All submissions have a strong focus on real world applications beyond the prototypical status and demonstrate the power of semantic systems!</p>

<h2>Author Guidelines and Submission</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">This call for presentations reaches out to professionals in the areas related to the topics of SEMANTiCS for proposals to present industry implementations, best practices and use case prototypes, to discuss semantic systems in birds-of-a-feather sessions as well as informal settings. Additionally, we explicitly encourage the submission of software applications, apps or services that demonstrate the usefulness and benefits of semantic technologies and semantic data management.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">An industry and use case presentation allows your organisation or project to advance and promote your topics and gain increased visibility. It gives you the chance to network with experts in a variety of fields. These relationships provide great value to organisations as they encounter subtle technical issues in any stage of implementation. The expertise gained by SEMANTiCS attendees has a long-term impact on their careers and organisations. These factors make SEMANTiCS for our community the major industry related event across Europe.</p>
